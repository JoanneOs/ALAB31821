This is a basic Express.js website I built to practice web development. It does a few simple but important things: shows a homepage, an about page, handles form submissions, and lets users download an image. I set it up by running a few commands to create the project structure and install necessary tools. The pages use EJS templates to display dynamic content, and there's a folder for images and CSS.
